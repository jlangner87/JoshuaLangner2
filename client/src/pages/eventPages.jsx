        <p className='services_content_body'>A wedding website is the ideal place to store all your wedding-related documents, photos, contact information and checklist items in one spot where your guests can access everything easily. You can also use it to send out announcements, keep track of RSVPs and provide answers to any questions your guests may have about the big day - all in one convenient place!</p>

        <h3 className='services_content_subheader'>Why a custom wedding page?</h3>
        <p className='services_content_body'>When it comes to wedding websites, there are two main options; self-service or custom built. </p>
        <p className='services_content_body'>Self-service sites often seem like a simple way to get your planning process started. However, they take a lot of effort and time to set up â€” adding unnecessary stress to the already overwhelming process of planning a wedding. Meanwhile, creative expression is limited to pre-designed templates.</p>
        <p className='services_content_body'>Custom built wedding websites are designed specifically for each couple and give the opportunity to showcase the couple's style and personality in every detail. Couples can truly capture the spirit of their special day with the perfect design elements tailored just for them. And all of the hard work is done by someone else, enabling them to relax and enjoy the planning process.

        <p className='services_content_action'>Smash some limits with me and celebrate your big day your way! <br/>Organized. Easy. Enjoyable. </p>
        <p className='services_content_note'>Pricing varies depending on the scope of the project. You can request a free estimate below.</p>
